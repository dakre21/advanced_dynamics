Assume the beam has a mass $m$ and the spring behaves linearly with spring constant $k$. Also assume the unstretched length of the spring is $R$.}{1}{}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {2}The work-energy principle says that the work done by all external forces on a particle or rigid body is equal to the change in kinetic energy that it $W_{1 \to 2} = \Delta T$, where $T$ is the kinetic energy. Show that if the work term is broken up into the work done by conservative forces and the work done by non-conservative forces, $W_{1 \to 2} = W_{1 \to 2}^C + W_{1 \to 2}^{NC}$, then the work-energy principle becomes $W_{1 \to 2}^{NC} = \Delta T + \Delta V$. Also, show that if the work done by non-conservative forces acting the on the system $W_{1 \to 2}^{NC} = 0$, then the system energy $E = T + V$ is conserved between the initial and final states.}{2}{}\protected@file@percent }

If this system starts at rest at the initial state $\theta = 0^\circ $, find the spring constant $k$ required such that the system is at rest in the final state $\theta = 90^{\circ }$ clockwise in terms of m, g, L, and R.}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {4}The system shown consists of a uniform rigid link of mass $m$ and length $L$ and the two springs with stiffness $k_1$ and $k_2$ respectively. When the springs are unstretched, the link is horizontal. Use the principle of virtual work to calculate the relationship between the angle $\theta $ and the parameters $k_1$, $k_2$, $m$, and $l$ at equilibrium.}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }
