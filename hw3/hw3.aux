Each of the three masses is $m = 0.5\text  {kg}$. The rod $OA$ rotates about point $O$ in the CCW direction at a constant rate $\omega _1 = 3\text  {rad/s}$. The wheel rotates with respect to the arm about $A$ with angular acceleration $\alpha _2 = 3\text  {rad/s}^2$ and at the instant shown it has angular velocity $\omega _2 = 5\text  {rad/s}$.
